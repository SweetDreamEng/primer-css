# [primer-css]( https://github.com/styleguide )

**Version:** `4.0.0`

> Primer is the CSS toolkit that powers GitHub's front-end design. It's purposefully limited to common components to provide our developers with the most flexibility, and to keep GitHub uniquely *GitHubby*. It's built with SCSS and available via Bower, so it's easy to include all or part of it within your own project.
