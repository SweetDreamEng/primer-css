## Releasing a new Primer version ðŸŽ‰


### In `primer/primer`:


1. Go through the tracking PR and make sure everything listed is merged in.

2. To update the changelog for your release, click on the details links for the continuous-integration/travis-ci/push build. Expand the `Deploying application` output and copy the changelog content. Update the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/primer/primer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file with the changelog content from build

    **Note**: the CHANGELOG contents may be hidden within a collapsed section of the Travis logs under `Deploying the application`. Click the â–¶ to the left of that section to expand it:

    Then scroll to the bottom of the page, and copy all of the text between the `Unreleased (YYYY-MM-DD)` heading and the exit status message. You may need to copy _before_ releasing your mouse to prevent Travis from collapsing that section of the logs first:

3. Bump the package versions in your terminal:

   ```sh
   npm run bump
   ```

4. Run `script/check-versions` to catch any cross-module version mismatches. (This will run on Travis, too.)

5. Test your changes with the latest release candidate version in the appropriate places (styleguide, storybook, github/github).

6. Once the release PR is approved and you've done necessary testing, merge to `master`. This will trigger publishing to npm.

7. Create a new release branch for the next release from `master` and name it `release-<version>`. Please use the following template for the PR description, linking to the relevant issues and/or pull requests for each change, and removing irrelevant headings:

    ```md
