## Releasing a new Primer version ðŸŽ‰


### In `primer/primer`:


1. Go through the tracking PR and make sure everything listed is merged in.

2. To update the change log for your release, click on the details links for the continuous-integration/travis-ci/push build.  Expand the `Deploying application` output and copy the change log content. Update the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/primer/primer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file with the change log content from the build.

3. Bump the package versions in your terminal:

  ```sh
  npm run bump
  ```

4. Run `script/check-versions` to catch any cross-module version mismatches. You may need to update peer dependencies in `primer-popover` and `primer-marketing-buttons`.

5. Test your changes with the latest release candidate version in the appropriate places (styleguide, storybook, github/github).

6. Once the release PR is approved and you've done necessary testing, merge to `master`. This will trigger publishing to npm.

7. Create a new release branch for the next release from `master` and name it `release-<version>`. Please use the following template for the PR description:

    ```md
    # Primer [Major|Minor|Patch] Release
